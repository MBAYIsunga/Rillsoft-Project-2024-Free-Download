# Enforcing-Privacy-with-Cryptography
From Deitel's "Java: How to Program" 10th edition

"Replace each digit with the result of adding 7 to the digit and getting the remainder after dividing the new value by 10. 
Then swap the first digit with tthe third, and swap the second digit with the fourth. Then print the encrypted interger. 
Write a separate application that inputs an encrypted four-digit integer and decrypts it( by reversing the encryption scheme) 
to form the original number."
